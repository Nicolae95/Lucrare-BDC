In this project, I covered the fundamentals of stored procedures and some specific properties pertaining to them. Of course, I should continue your studies in areas like security, SQL statements, and performance before you can master SQL routines.\par
Stored Procedures may not always be the right answer for processing data, but there’s also not enough compelling evidence to not use them either. Whether or not to use them determines on your particular situation and ability to develop the Stored Procedure(s) to match. Just like with writing a good, quality application, if you or your developers can write good, quality Stored Procedures, then by all means implement them. If they can’t, then another solution might be best for you.\par
I generally use procedures, their benefits in terms of security, code maintenance and software design make them worthy of use, in my opinion.
